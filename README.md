# CompMethodsProjects
For the Computational Methods for Data Scientist course, I used python and R to solve different machine learning problems. The topics of these assignments included Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, AdaBoost, XGBoost, Model Evaluation, Convolutional Neural Networks, TensorFlow, Unsupervised Learning, Recommendation Systems, and Frequent Pattern Mining.
